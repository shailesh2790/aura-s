Aura OS PRD – PM Self‑Serve Workflow & Prototype Builder1. PROBLEM STATEMENTPMs cannot automate workflows or build and test prototypes without AI or engineering help. Existing tools force PMs to think in code, nodes, or prompts instead of goals, experiments, and flows.2. PRODUCT VISIONAura OS lets PMs describe workflows and prototypes in product language and automatically builds, runs, tests, and evaluates them in a safe sandbox.3. TARGET USERPrimary: Product Managers (ICs, Leads)Job: Build, test, and validate ideas without engineers.4. CORE USE CASES- Workflow automation in PM language- Rapid AI feature prototyping- Hypothesis and experiment testing5. PRODUCT PRINCIPLES- PM language only- Safe by default- Build → Test → Learn loops- Explainability over magic- Prototype ≠ production6. KEY FEATURES6.1 Prompt‑to‑Workflow BuilderAura converts PM goals into editable workflow steps written in plain English.6.2 Workflow SandboxSimulated users, data, APIs, and time‑compressed execution to test ideas risk‑free.6.3 Prototype BuilderAuto‑generated conversational flows, forms, and UI steps with logs and insights.6.4 Experiment EngineAutomatically defines variants, runs tests, collects metrics, and recommends outcomes.6.5 Explainability & Learning ReportsEvery run outputs what was built, tested, learned, and what to try next.6.6 Engineering HandoffAura generates workflow specs, data contracts, edge cases, and metrics for engineers.7. UX DESIGNSections: Goal → Workflow → Simulation → Insights → Next Actions.No exposure to APIs, nodes, models, or code.8. ARCHITECTURE- Intent Interpreter- Workflow Planner- Sandbox Runtime- Agent Executors- Experiment Evaluator- Explainability Engine9. MVP ROADMAPPhase 1: Prompt → Workflow, Sandbox, Learning ReportPhase 2: Experiment Engine, Metrics, PrototypesPhase 3: Engineering Handoff, Integrations10. SUCCESS METRICS- Time from idea to test (<30 mins)- % workflows built without help- Experiments per PM per month- Engineering acceptance rate11. STRATEGIC IMPACTAura becomes the upstream system where ideas become validated execution before engineering investment.
