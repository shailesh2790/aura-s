Below is a 
full, ready-to-build startup blueprint
 for your automation platform (Aura OS / PM Automation OS).
This is based on all your previous requirements: 
prompt-to-automation
, 
agentic orchestration
, 
PM-focused workflows
, 
multi-agent execution
, 
reliability
, and 
no-code UX
.
This Blueprint contains:
Category Name You Should Dominate
Positioning Strategy (Like “Linear for PM automations”)
Core Problem Statement
Product Vision – 1 Sentence
Feature Blueprint (MVP → v1 → v2)
Tech Architecture (Multi-Agent System)
Pricing Strategy
GTM Strategy
Differentiation Strategy vs n8n, Zapier, Make, CrewAI
Investor Narrative Deck Outline
🚀
 1. Market Category You Should Create & Own
“Autonomous Product Management Automation OS”
(short name: 
PM Automation OS
)
Position yourself NOT as a workflow builder like n8n, but as:
The operating system for autonomous execution of product workflows — research, planning, documentation, analytics, and roadmap delivery.
This is a new category → winner-take-most.
🎯
 2. Tagline / Positioning
“Give your product team a goal. Aura OS builds and executes everything.”
or
“Product Management Without Manual Work.”
or
“The autonomous agent that handles your PM backlog.”
🔥
 3. The Core Problem (What PMs Hate Right Now)
PMs spend 70% of time on repetitive, non-strategic tasks:
Writing PRDs
Competitive research
Market analysis
Data extraction
User interviews summary
Reporting metrics
Writing Jira tickets
Grooming backlog
Documentation
Stakeholder alignment
These tasks require:
reasoning
context awareness
tool usage
iteration
⚠️
 
n8n, Zapier, Make CANNOT solve these
 because they follow rigid flows.
⚠️
 LLM chatbots CANNOT solve them because they can’t use tools or maintain memory.
Nobody solves autonomous PM workflows today.
🌟
 4. Vision (One Sentence)
“A single goal in → autonomous PM workflows out — PRDs, analysis, workflows, Jira updates, documents, insights — done automatically.”
🧠
 5. Product Blueprint
🟩
 MVP Feature Set (Launch in 30–45 days)
The smallest set of features that proves the value.
1. Prompt-to-Automation
User says:
“Create a competitive analysis for Notion vs Linear and summarize in a PRD.”
Aura OS will:
plan tasks
use researcher agent
browse the web
extract structured data
write a benchmark
create a PRD
send a Slack summary
attach to Jira
No nodes. No scripting. No setup.
2. Multi-Agent PM Workspace
3–5 pre-built agents:
Research Agent
PRD Writer Agent
UX Writer Agent
Analyst Agent
Jira Manager Agent
Each agent uses tools & shares memory.
3. Automatic Document Generation
PRDs
Market research docs
Roadmap summaries
Sprint reports
Jira ticket writing
4. PM Inbox Automation
User uploads:
recordings
chats
stakeholder notes
Agent turns them into actionable tasks + documents.
5. Jira / Slack / Linear integration
Use simple OAuth-based tool calling.
6. Memory Layer
Every project gets:
project memory
requirement memory
competitive intelligence memory
So next time PM asks:
“Update PRD based on latest competitor change.”
Agent knows everything.
🟦
 V1 (After PMF Validation)
1. Visual Automation Map (Generated Automatically)
Instead of nodes:
AI creates workflow graph
user can edit with natural language
2. Agent App Store
Users add micro-agents:
Design agent
Analytics agent
Product-market-fit agent
Experimentation agent
GTM agent
3. Versioning & Git Sync
Every PRD → Git commit.
🟨
 V2 (Category Winner Stage)
1. Fully Autonomous PM Co-pilot
PM gives goals:
“Ship onboarding revamp by Feb 15.”
“Improve retention by 16%.”
“Research Q2 market trends.”
System:
creates strategy
executes research
drafts execution plan
updates Jira
sends reports
runs experiments
updates Notion docs
This is where competition CANNOT follow.
🏗
 6. Tech Architecture (Agentic + Reliable)
Your architecture should look like this:
Layer 1 — User Intent Engine
Extracts goals
Generates a multi-step plan
Defines agents required
Generates tool usage plan
Layer 2 — Multi-Agent System
Use:
CrewAI
 or 
Autogen
 or custom LangGraph
Agents:
Research agent
Data agent
PRD agent
UX writing agent
Jira agent
Slack/email agent
Layer 3 — Self-Correcting Runtime
Agents automatically:
retry
re-plan
find alternative tools
escalate if stuck
log reasoning
Layer 4 — Tool Layer
Integrations:
Google Search
Browser
Jira / Linear
Slack
Notion
GitHub
Internal APIs
Layer 5 — Memory + Vector Store
A memory per:
project
product area
company context
user preferences
Tools:
Pinecone
Chroma
Weaviate
Layer 6 — Frontend (Simple Workspace)
Web app with:
project folders
agent runs
document outputs
PM command center
Think:
Linear + Notion + ChatGPT + n8n, merged into one.
💰
 7. Pricing Strategy
Starter (Free / $9)
limited agent runs
PRD generator
research agent
Pro / Individual PM ($29–49 monthly)
unlimited documents
Jira/Slack integrations
project memory
autonomous workflows
Team ($199–399/month)
shared memory
collaboration
workflow governance
Enterprise ($1,500/mo → 100k/mo)
SSO
private deployment
custom agents
SOC2
internal tool integrations
admin dashboards
📈
 8. GTM Strategy
1. Target segment: PMs & Founders
These two groups have highest willingness to pay.
2. Viral Content Engine
demo videos
AI PRD generation
AI competitor analysis
“Build this product in 60 seconds” videos
This goes viral easily.
3. Bottom-up SaaS
Start with individual PMs
Expand into teams
Land-and-expand into enterprise
4. Templates Marketplace
PRDs
competitive analysis
roadmaps
experiment frameworks
🥇

🔥
 10. Investor Storyline
Slide 1 — The Future of Work is Agentic
Automation is shifting from “flows” → “autonomous teams of agents.”
Slide 2 — PMs Are Drowning in Manual Work
$25B market.
Slide 3 — Old automation fails
n8n, Zapier: too rigid
LLM chatbots: too dumb
CrewAI: too technical
PMs: underserved
Slide 4 — Aura OS = Autonomous PM Execution Engine
Single prompt → multi-agent plan → documents → Jira → Slack → reports
Slide 5 — Why Now?
LLM agents mature
Enterprises need productivity
PM tooling fragmented
OpenAI function calling + memory breakthroughs
Slide 6 — Traction Engine
PRD generator → viral
PM communities → adoption
Slide 7 — Business Model
PLG + enterprise expansion.
Slide 8 — Team
You + strong engineering + AI research.

 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Aura OS — Autonomous Product Management Automation System
Version:
 v1.0
Owner:
 Shailesh Tripathi
Date:
 Dec 2025
1. 
🔥
 Executive Summary
Product Managers today spend 
70–80%
 of their time on repetitive, cognitive-heavy but low-leverage work:
Writing PRDs
Market & competitive research
Creating Jira tickets
Grooming backlog
Summarizing user feedback
Preparing sprint reports
Monitoring metrics
Documentation
Existing tools—n8n, Zapier, Make, CrewAI—are too rigid or too technical to automate PM workflows.
LLM chatbots can generate content but 
cannot execute end-to-end workflows
.
Aura OS is the first autonomous system that takes a product goal as input and automatically:
Plans multi-step workflows
Uses reasoning agents
Performs research
Creates documents
Updates Jira / Linear
Sends stakeholder summaries
Iterates with memory
Executes PM workflows end-to-end
Aura OS = Linear for automations + Notion for intelligence + Autonomous multi-agent system for execution.
2. 
🎯
 Problem Statement
Product Teams Are Overwhelmed
Today’s PMs are drowning in:
fragmented tools
manual research
writing docs from scratch
repetitive execution
endless alignment meetings
disconnected Jira/Notion updates
Current Automation Tools Fail Because:
Problem
Why It Matters
No reasoning or planning
PM workflows require context + intelligence
No memory
Agents forget project details
No dynamic tool selection
PMs use many disconnected tools
Rigid node-based flows
PM tasks evolve and change weekly
No document intelligence
PM work is document-heavy
No cross-agent collaboration
PM tasks require research + writing + execution
PM workflows require intelligent, agentic automation — not flowchart automation.
3. 
🧭
 Product Vision
“Give Aura a product goal. Aura thinks, plans, researches, writes, updates tasks, communicates, and delivers outputs — autonomously.”
Aura OS becomes the 
co-PM
 that handles all operational work, enabling human PMs to focus on strategy and decisions.
